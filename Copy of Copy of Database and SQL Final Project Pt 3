Database Design Philosophy\n","In 150 to 200 words, answer the question **\"What are the keys to designing a successful database, and how is this reflected in your own work here?\"**\n","\n","A successful database emerges from great groundwork. I would first plan out how the database is designed by brainstorming what tables and attributes should be put together as well as their rules to help format them. I would then create an ER diagram, like in class, to produce a visual of what is going to be done. I would map that same ER model to construct a relational model and double check whether it passes all three normal forms. If the model is completely passable, I create the tables from the relational model and test it using simple SQL queries to see if the database can handle straightforward tasks. I would also add data first on a small scale and then gradually increase the amount. If all goes well, I use complicated SQL queries to test if the database is well-designed. Of course, this is all what I have accomplished in this class. However, I believe a successful database doesn’t stop there. I would also save backups of the database, plan for setbacks, and routinely check if the database could be optimized in any way.

The making of the tables and ER diagram and such is a little dull to me. I believe part of it was that I didn’t truly grasp the idea behind them. However, I do enjoy the queries as it is simplified coding in a sense. Nevertheless, some of the queries do require thinking as to approach how to look for something in a database. Doing these queries made me really appreciate the work I put into them. The first two parts of the final project had subpar work put into them, but I wanted to reform my work into something better. I had gone back and changed what I had put for my business rules, redone my ER diagram, and reread terms to get a better understanding of what exactly I was doing.
